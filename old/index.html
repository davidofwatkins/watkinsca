          No need to dodge the sleet  and flurries,<br />
          Closing out two thousand  nine,<br />
          We’ve left behind all last  year’s worries.</p>
          <p class="n_small">You may have missed our  card last year,<br />
            No doubt because ‘twas  never sent,<br />
            Things were rather hectic  here,<br />
            Our relocation left us  spent.</p>
          <p class="n_small">But after all the  aggravation,<br />
            Our home we feel is now  unmatched,<br />
            To garner last year’s  situation,<br />
            Last year’s poem please  find attached.</p>
          <p class="n_small">This year the theme was  education,<br />
            High school first then  college bound,<br />
            In June there was a  graduation,<br />
            Friends and family all  around.</p>
          <p class="n_small">Sage Hill’s David’s school  of choice,<br />
            Just getting in was doing  well,<br />
            Yet here he learned to find  his voice,<br />
            To learn, to grow and to  excel.</p>
          <p class="n_small">Aunt Natalie and Cousin  Sue,<br />
            Flew in to join the  celebration,<br />
            The Keown clan and Myron  too,<br />
            Joined us in the  congregation.</p>
          <p class="n_small">This happy high school  culmination,<br />
            Was just a part of Binks’  plan,<br />
            Eleven schools across the  nation,<br />
            Were targets of his college  scan.</p>
          <p class="n_small">For months the application  stress,<br />
            Of  S.A.T.s and essay prose,<br />
            Felt like just a giant  mess,<br />
            As the process came to  close.</p>
          <p class="n_small">We flew to schools around  the nation,<br />
            Got into eight but then  which one?<br />
            He tried to find the right  sensation,<br />
            Before the college search  was done</p>
          <p class="n_small">Champlain College won the  day<br />
            Though UPS was also great,<br />
            But boy Vermont is far  away,<br />
            Though both indeed are out  of state.</p>
          <p class="n_small">Father’s Day this year was  grand,<br />
            Travelling East went Binks  and Dad,<br />
            To Falling Waters first as  planned,<br />
            Then to Deb and Karen’s  pad.</p>
          <p class="n_small">It was for Dad a priceless  time,<br />
            Kids and grandkids gathered  ‘round,<br />
            A gathering he found  sublime,<br />
            A missing piece together  found.</p>
          <p class="n_small">We journeyed next to visit  Nat,<br />
            For voice camp and a brief  respite,<br />
            Rested with her dog and  cat,<br />
          Saw Robb and Julie out one  night.</p></td>
        <td align="left" valign="top"><p>Back at home Laguna Beach,<br />
          Proved to be the perfect  place,<br />
          For Debbie’s David’s  surprise speech,<br />
          Popped the question, made  his case.</p>
          <p>Strolling through the park that  day,<br />
            Unleashing our conspiracy,<br />
            Rose petals spelled out on  the way,<br />
            “Debbie, will you marry me”.</p>
          <p>Then we travelled to Vermont,<br />
            David’s first day at Champlain,<br />
            Though this was all that we  could want,<br />
            Still, a bittersweet  refrain.  </p>
          <p>For Shannon and her long  time beau,<br />
            We held a festive wedding  gala,<br />
            Bride and groom were all  aglow,<br />
            With all at our Casa  Querida.</p>
          <p>It was a perfect wedding  day,<br />
            Lest I forget then let me  hasten,<br />
            Amidst the fun let’s also  say,<br />
            Welcome to the family  Jason.</p>
          <p>Afterwards ‘twas parents  day,<br />
            Seeing Binks for just a  weekend,<br />
            Thanksgiving week he came  our way,<br />
            Perhaps these trips portend  a trend.</p>
          <p>A few days down in Mexcio,<br />
            Put our lives somewhat in  order,<br />
            But as all of our travels  go,<br />
            We always count on Bogie’s  boarder.</p>
          <p>Bogie loves to play and  walk,<br />
            His favorite place is on  the beach,<br />
            He often stops to smell and  gawk,<br />
            Knowing we are within  reach.</p>
          <p>When away then Joni stays,<br />
            To be with her old canine  soul,<br />
            Or Bogie’s watched in other  ways,<br />
            Like Charlene in the sitter  role.</p>
          <p>There were some changes  through the year,<br />
            Paul and Janis moved away,<br />
            Yet Bella Moda brought us  cheer,<br />
            And treasured neighbors made  the day.</p>
          <p>Now it’s nearly closing time,<br />
            The year is up, the  feeling’s fine,<br />
            We hope you like this  fractured rhyme,<br />
            But you can find much more  online.</p>
          <p>As the year slips to its  end,<br />
            May all your fears and  worries cease,<br />
            We hope our wishes will  extend,<br />
          To joy on earth and lasting  peace.</p>

        <td valign="top"><p>Perhaps you noticed late  last year,<br />
          The absence of our  Christmas greeting,<br />
          Wishing you good will and  cheer,<br />
          With stories we thought worth repeating.</p>
          <p>Sorry but we’ve had  delays,<br />
            That left us quite disorganized,<br />
            And struggling through the  holidaze,<br />
            Led to having plans  revised.</p>
          <p>So here at last is 08s card,<br />
            We trust it find’s you  well and fine,<br />
            And though the times seem  very hard,<br />
            Here’s to a fine two thousand  nine.</p>
          <p>We hope we will eliminate,<br />
            That which was our source  of stress,<br />
            Our house remodel’s looking  great,<br />
            Though it is still sort of  a mess.</p>
          <p>Of course there will be  lots to do,<br />
            It’s been around for 80  years.<br />
            With Michael’s help,  Elizabeth too,<br />
            We’ll navigate through  sweat and tears.</p>
          <p>On top of all this rush  and hassle,<br />
            David O. is college bound,<br />
            A senior soon to wear a tassel,<br />
            Calls and visits school’s  he’s found.</p>
          <p>Once we three a journey  took,<br />
            Saw five schools within a  week,<br />
            It’s best to get the feel  and look,<br />
            But frenzied flights  aren’t for the meek.</p>
          <p>After school, Binks with  Mary,<br />
            Flew to Nat’s and spent  some time,<br />
            At voice camp with his  teacher Kerry,<br />
            Amidst Vermont’s milieu  sublime.</p>
          <p>As if they hadn’t seen  enough,<br />
            They trekked to schools  there and about,<br />
            The college search can  sure be rough,<br />
            But better that than  having doubt.</p>
          <p>Allie came to San Diego,<br />
            There she learned to shoot  the curl,<br />
            Risky but then what do we  know,<br />
            Now we have a surfer girl.</p>
          <p>Another trip defies  description,<br />
            David travelled solitary,<br />
            Recipient of a  prescription,<br />
            Courtesy of his wife Mary.</p>
          <p>To celebrate his 60 years,<br />
            Two weeks in Scotland was  the gift,<br />
            A week of golf and several  beers,<br />
          Then to Iona for a lift.</p></td>
        <td valign="top"><p>Golf was spent with good  friend Mike,<br />
          On links of British Open  fame,<br />
          A walk-through-nature  spoiled hike,<br />
          But lovely golfing just  the same.</p>
          <p>To space out for a little  while,<br />
            A special place he went to  see, <br />
            Iona is a Celtic isle,<br />
            To feed the soul and just  to be.</p>
          <p>All the while sister Nat,<br />
            Jetted to the other Coast,<br />
            And there with Mary showed  us that,<br />
            Family is what matters  most.</p>
          <p>Something we appreciated,<br />
            When suddenly we found her  ill,<br />
            And loved ones there soon aggregated,<br />
            Recovered now, they’re  with her still.</p>
          <p>Another day still found us  sadly,<br />
            Mourning for our good  friend Don,<br />
            Who left us shocked and feeling  badly,<br />
            Though he’d tell us ”just go  on”.</p>
          <p>This of course is what  we’ll do,<br />
            Jean says she is hanging  in there,<br />
            And though some things  remain askew,<br />
            We grow together self  aware.<br />
            <br />
            Evident on Christmas day, <br />
            The first one spent at our  new house,<br />
            Jean just loves to come  and stay,<br />
            Close to Mary, cute as a mouse.</p>
          <p>The family count was quite  a tally,<br />
            A gathering that was  sublime,<br />
            Diana came along with  Sally.<br />
            The picture of a happy  time.</p>
          <p>Apologies to the  Northeast,<br />
            As well as those around  Seattle,<br />
            It feels like 80 out, at  least,<br />
            There is no snow or ice to  battle.</p>
          <p>But you can visit as you  will,<br />
            As well as those now  living near,<br />
            And we can travel your way  still,<br />
            You are all that we hold  dear.</p>
          <p>So greetings from Laguna  Beach,<br />
            All the best this coming  year,<br />
            Everything is within  reach,<br />
            Let’s bring in peace and cast  out fear.<br />
