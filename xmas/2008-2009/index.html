              <tr>
                <td width="55%" valign="top"><p>The weather in Laguna’s fine,<br />
                  No need to dodge the sleet and flurries,<br />
                  Closing out two thousand nine,<br />
                  We’ve left behind all last year’s worries.<br /><br />

                  You may have missed our card last year,<br />
                  No doubt because ‘twas never sent,<br />
                  Things were rather hectic here,<br />
                  Our relocation left us spent.<br /><br />

                  But after all the aggravation,<br />
                  Our home we feel is now unmatched,<br />
                  To garner last year’s situation,<br />
                  Last year’s poem please find attached.<br /><br />

                  This year the theme was education,<br />
                  High school first then college bound,<br />
                  In June there was a graduation,<br />
                  Friends and family all around.<br /><br />

                  Sage Hill’s David’s school of choice,<br />
                  Just getting in was doing well,<br />
                  Yet here he learned to find his voice,<br />
                  To learn, to grow and to excel.<br /><br />

                  Aunt Natalie and Cousin Sue,<br />
                  Flew in to join the celebration,<br />
                  The Keown clan and Myron too,<br />
                  Joined us in the congregation.<br /><br />

                  This happy high school culmination,<br />
                  Was just a part of Binks’ plan,<br />
                  Eleven schools across the nation,<br />
                  Were targets of his college scan.<br /><br />

                  For months the application stress,<br />
                  Of S.A.T.s and essay prose,<br />
                  Felt like just a giant mess,<br />
                  As the process came to close.<br /><br />

                  We flew to schools around the nation,<br />
                  Got into eight but then which one?<br />
                  He tried to find the right sensation,<br />
                  Before the college search was done<br /><br />

                  Champlain College won the day<br />
                  Though UPS was also great,<br />
                  But boy Vermont is far away,<br />
                  Though both indeed are out of state.<br /><br />

                  Father’s Day this year was grand,<br />
                  Travelling East went Binks and Dad,<br />
                  To Falling Waters first as planned,<br />
                  Then to Deb and Karen’s pad.<br /><br />

                  It was for Dad a priceless time,<br />
                  Kids and grandkids gathered ‘round,<br />
                  A gathering he found sublime,<br />
                  A missing piece together found.<br /><br />

                  We journeyed next to visit Nat,<br />
                  For voice camp and a brief respite,<br />
                  Rested with her dog and cat,<br />
                Saw Robb and Julie out one night.</p></td>
                <td width="45%" valign="top"><p>Back at home Laguna Beach,<br />
                  Proved to be the perfect place,<br />
                  For Debbie’s David’s surprise speech,<br />
                  Popped the question, made his case.<br /><br />

                  Strolling through the park that day,<br />
                  Unleashing our conspiracy,<br />
                  Rose petals spelled out on the way,<br />
                  “Debbie, will you marry me”.<br /><br />

                  Then we travelled to Vermont,<br />
                  David’s first day at Champlain,<br />
                  Though this was all that we could want,<br />
                  Still, a bittersweet refrain.<br /><br />

                  For Shannon and her long time beau,<br />
                  We held a festive wedding gala,<br />
                  Bride and groom were all aglow,<br />
                  With all at our Casa Querida.<br /><br />

                  It was a perfect wedding day,<br />
                  Lest I forget then let me hasten,<br />
                  Amidst the fun let’s also say,<br />
                  Welcome to the family Jason.<br /><br />

                  Afterwards ‘twas parents day,<br />
                  Seeing Binks for just a weekend,<br />
                  Thanksgiving week he came our way,<br />
                  Perhaps these trips portend a trend.<br /><br />

                  A few days down in Mexcio,<br />
                  Put our lives somewhat in order,<br />
                  But as all of our travels go,<br />
                  We always count on Bogie’s boarder.<br /><br />

                  Bogie loves to play and walk,<br />
                  His favorite place is on the beach,<br />
                  He often stops to smell and gawk,<br />
                  Knowing we are within reach.<br /><br />

                  When away then Joni stays,<br />
                  To be with her old canine soul,<br />
                  Or Bogie’s watched in other ways,<br />
                  Like Charlene in the sitter role.<br /><br />

                  There were some changes through the year,<br />
                  Paul and Janis moved away,<br />
                  Yet Bella Moda brought us cheer,<br />
                  And treasured neighbors made the day.<br /><br />

                  Now it’s nearly closing time,<br />
                  The year is up, the feeling’s fine,<br />
                  We hope you like this fractured rhyme,<br />
                  But you can find much more online.<br /><br />

                  As the year slips to its end,<br />
                  May all your fears and worries cease,<br />
                  We hope our wishes will extend,<br />
                  To joy on earth and lasting peace.</p>

        <h3>2008 Poem</h3>
        <center><table width="60%" border="0" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="10" style="text-align: left;">
              <tr>
                <td width="55%" valign="top"><p>Perhaps you noticed late last year,<br />
                  The absence of our Christmas greeting,<br />
                  Wishing you good will and cheer,<br />
                  With stories we thought worth repeating.<br /><br />

                  Sorry but we’ve had delays,<br />
                  That left us quite disorganized,<br />
                  And struggling through the holidaze,<br />
                  Led to having plans revised.<br /><br />

                  So here at last is 08s card,<br />
                  We trust it find’s you well and fine,<br />
                  And though the times seem very hard,<br />
                  Here’s to a fine two thousand nine.<br /><br />

                  We hope we will eliminate,<br />
                  That which was our source of stress,<br />
                  Our house remodel’s looking great,<br />
                  Though it is still sort of a mess.<br /><br />

                  Of course there will be lots to do,<br />
                  It’s been around for 80 years.<br />
                  With Michael’s help, Elizabeth too,<br />
                  We’ll navigate through sweat and tears.<br /><br />

                  On top of all this rush and hassle,<br />
                  David O. is college bound,<br />
                  A senior soon to wear a tassel,<br />
                  Calls and visits school’s he’s found.<br /><br />

                  Once we three a journey took,<br />
                  Saw five schools within a week,<br />
                  It’s best to get the feel and look,<br />
                  But frenzied flights aren’t for the meek.<br /><br />

                  After school, Binks with Mary,<br />
                  Flew to Nat’s and spent some time,<br />
                  At voice camp with his teacher Kerry,<br />
                  Amidst Vermont’s milieu sublime.<br /><br />

                  As if they hadn’t seen enough,<br />
                  They trekked to schools there and about,<br />
                  The college search can sure be rough,<br />
                  But better that than having doubt.<br /><br />

                  Allie came to San Diego,<br />
                  There she learned to shoot the curl,<br />
                  Risky but then what do we know,<br />
                  Now we have a surfer girl.<br /><br />

                  Another trip defies description,<br />
                  David travelled solitary,<br />
                  Recipient of a prescription,<br />
                  Courtesy of his wife Mary.<br /><br />

                  To celebrate his 60 years,<br />
                  Two weeks in Scotland was the gift,<br />
                  A week of golf and several beers,<br />
                Then to Iona for a lift.</p></td>
                <td width="45%" valign="top"><p>Golf was spent with good friend Mike,<br />
                  On links of British Open fame,<br />
                  A walk-through-nature spoiled hike,<br />
                  But lovely golfing just the same.<br /><br />

                  To space out for a little while,<br />
                  A special place he went to see,<br />
                  Iona is a Celtic isle,<br />
                  To feed the soul and just to be.<br /><br />

                  All the while sister Nat,<br />
                  Jetted to the other Coast,<br />
                  And there with Mary showed us that,<br />
                  Family is what matters most.<br /><br />

                  Something we appreciated,<br />
                  When suddenly we found her ill,<br />
                  And loved ones there soon aggregated,<br />
                  Recovered now, they’re with her still.<br /><br />

                  Another day still found us sadly,<br />
                  Mourning for our good friend Don,<br />
                  Who left us shocked and feeling badly,<br />
                  Though he’d tell us ”just go on”.<br /><br />

                  This of course is what we’ll do,<br />
                  Jean says she is hanging in there,<br />
                  And though some things remain askew,<br />
                  We grow together self aware.<br /><br />

                  Evident on Christmas day,<br />
                  The first one spent at our new house,<br />
                  Jean just loves to come and stay,<br />
                  Close to Mary, cute as a mouse.<br /><br />

                  The family count was quite a tally,<br />
                  A gathering that was sublime,<br />
                  Diana came along with Sally.<br />
                  The picture of a happy time.<br /><br />

                  Apologies to the Northeast,<br />
                  As well as those around Seattle,<br />
                  It feels like 80 out, at least,<br />
                  There is no snow or ice to battle.<br /><br />

                  But you can visit as you will,<br />
                  As well as those now living near,<br />
                  And we can travel your way still,<br />
                  You are all that we hold dear.<br /><br />

                  So greetings from Laguna Beach,<br />
                  All the best this coming year,<br />
                  Everything is within reach,<br />
                  Let’s bring in peace and cast out fear.</p>
