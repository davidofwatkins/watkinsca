                                    Amazingly it’s Christmas time,<br />
                                    Come upon us unannounced.<br />
                                    This season of goodwill sublime,<br />
                                    Stalked us through the year and pounced.<br /><br />

                                    Perhaps we’d not be so surprised<br />
                                    If in the course of daily living,<br />
                                    We saw that stores had advertised,<br />
                                    Starting long before Thanksgiving.<br /><br />

                                    We don’t suppose it really matters,<br />
                                    If we keep in mind that thought,<br />
                                    And little children’s pitter‐patters,<br />
                                    Mean much more than what we bought.<br /><br />

                                    Which brings us to the nitty‐gritty,<br />
                                    Raison d’état, our cause celeb,<br />
                                    This Watkins holiday rhyming ditty,<br />
                                    By mail, Email and on the web*.<br /><br />

                                    At sixteen David (Binks) is driving,<br />
                                    Seems so young and yet so old,<br />
                                    And as a junior he’s surviving,<br />
                                    High school with its stress untold.<br /><br />

                                    It’s hard to think this hearty lad,<br />
                                    Who’s grown in size as well as knowledge,<br />
                                    Is just about as tall as Dad,<br />
                                    And soon will go right off to college.<br /><br />

                                    Mary reached the big six oh,<br />
                                    We gathered in a special way,<br />
                                    Then she left us here to go<br />
                                    For an extended Celtic stay.<br /><br />

                                    To Scotland she went on her own,<br />
                                    Iona holy on the shore,<br />
                                    On retreat without a phone,<br />
                                    A spirit’s quest where less is more.<br /><br />

                                    David S. and David O.,<br />
                                    To learn more of the Gilchrist clan,<br />
                                    Met up with Mary on the go,<br />
                                    By jet, train, boat and then a van.<br /><br />

                                    A chance to sing with his Aunt Nat<br />
                                    Sent Binks and mom back to Vermont,<br />
                                    Where with others they found that<br />
                                    This was an important jaunt.<br /><br />

                                    At the same time we were blessed,<br />
                                    As dreams we had came within reach,<br />
                                    Good fortune ours came manifest,<br />
                                    As a new house down by the beach.

                                    More than just a place for three,<br />
                                    Lot’s of work but in a while,<br />
                                    To share with friends and family.<br /><br />

                                    Perfect though in every way,<br />
                                    For a girl back then thirteen,<br />
                                    Now to have a special day,<br />
                                    The 90th birthday of our Jean.<br /><br />

                                    The cousins White from Washington,<br />
                                    With Irina hopped a flight,<br />
                                    And joined us down here in the sun,<br />
                                    To their aunt’s complete delight.<br /><br />

                                    Friends and family in reunion,<br />
                                    Filled with love and admiration,<br />
                                    Experienced a fond communion,<br />
                                    At Jean Roberta’s celebration.<br /><br />

                                    Perhaps we’re now a destination,<br />
                                    For relatives to have some fun,<br />
                                    The Marks came out for their vacation,<br />
                                    With Kayla Jane and Allison.<br /><br />

                                    A visit from a special niece,<br />
                                    Elizabeth with Michael who<br />
                                    Brought fun and jokes that did not cease,<br />
                                    We almost saw the Eastwoods, too!<br /><br />

                                    We even lured another niece,<br />
                                    San Francisco Sue came down,<br />
                                    We all enjoyed a brief release,<br />
                                    And had some fun out on the town.<br /><br />

                                    Now the days are growing short,<br />
                                    Our Christmas card has been delayed,<br />
                                    But we are happy to report,<br />
                                    Our spirit’s good though somewhat frayed.<br /><br />

                                    Like everyone we need a ration,<br />
                                    All too rare it seems these days,<br />
                                    Of love, forgiveness and compassion,<br />
                                    So we relate in higher ways.<br /><br />

                                    These are the gifts we wish for you,<br />
                                    Not just today but all year long,<br />
                                    And as life’s travels take us through,<br />
                                    Let’s sing ourselves a joyful song.
