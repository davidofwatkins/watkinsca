                <td width="55%" valign="top"><p>Amazingly it’s Christmas time,<br />
                  Come upon us unannounced.<br />
                  This season of goodwill sublime,<br />
                  Stalked us through the year and pounced.<br /><br />

                  Perhaps we’d not be so surprised<br />
                  If in the course of daily living,<br />
                  We saw that stores had advertised,<br />
                  Starting long before Thanksgiving.<br /><br />

                  We don’t suppose it really matters,<br />
                  If we keep in mind that thought,<br />
                  And little children’s pitter‐patters,<br />
                  Mean much more than what we bought.<br /><br />

                  Which brings us to the nitty‐gritty,<br />
                  Raison d’état, our cause celeb,<br />
                  This Watkins holiday rhyming ditty,<br />
                  By mail, Email and on the web*.<br /><br />

                  At sixteen David (Binks) is driving,<br />
                  Seems so young and yet so old,<br />
                  And as a junior he’s surviving,<br />
                  High school with its stress untold.<br /><br />

                  It’s hard to think this hearty lad,<br />
                  Who’s grown in size as well as knowledge,<br />
                  Is just about as tall as Dad,<br />
                  And soon will go right off to college.<br /><br />

                  Mary reached the big six oh,<br />
                  We gathered in a special way,<br />
                  Then she left us here to go<br />
                  For an extended Celtic stay.<br /><br />

                  To Scotland she went on her own,<br />
                  Iona holy on the shore,<br />
                  On retreat without a phone,<br />
                  A spirit’s quest where less is more.<br /><br />

                  David S. and David O.,<br />
                  To learn more of the Gilchrist clan,<br />
                  Met up with Mary on the go,<br />
                  By jet, train, boat and then a van.<br /><br />

                  A chance to sing with his Aunt Nat<br />
                  Sent Binks and mom back to Vermont,<br />
                  Where with others they found that<br />
                  This was an important jaunt.<br /><br />

                  At the same time we were blessed,<br />
                  As dreams we had came within reach,<br />
                  Good fortune ours came manifest,<br />
                As a new house down by the beach.</p></td>
                <td width="45%" valign="top"><p>1930 Spanish style,<br />
                  More than just a place for three,<br />
                  Lot’s of work but in a while,<br />
                  To share with friends and family.<br /><br />

                  Perfect though in every way,<br />
                  For a girl back then thirteen,<br />
                  Now to have a special day,<br />
                  The 90th birthday of our Jean.<br /><br />

                  The cousins White from Washington,<br />
                  With Irina hopped a flight,<br />
                  And joined us down here in the sun,<br />
                  To their aunt’s complete delight.<br /><br />

                  Friends and family in reunion,<br />
                  Filled with love and admiration,<br />
                  Experienced a fond communion,<br />
                  At Jean Roberta’s celebration.<br /><br />

                  Perhaps we’re now a destination,<br />
                  For relatives to have some fun,<br />
                  The Marks came out for their vacation,<br />
                  With Kayla Jane and Allison.<br /><br />

                  A visit from a special niece,<br />
                  Elizabeth with Michael who<br />
                  Brought fun and jokes that did not cease,<br />
                  We almost saw the Eastwoods, too!<br /><br />

                  We even lured another niece,<br />
                  San Francisco Sue came down,<br />
                  We all enjoyed a brief release,<br />
                  And had some fun out on the town.<br /><br />

                  Now the days are growing short,<br />
                  Our Christmas card has been delayed,<br />
                  But we are happy to report,<br />
                  Our spirit’s good though somewhat frayed.<br /><br />

                  Like everyone we need a ration,<br />
                  All too rare it seems these days,<br />
                  Of love, forgiveness and compassion,<br />
                  So we relate in higher ways.<br /><br />

                  These are the gifts we wish for you,<br />
                  Not just today but all year long,<br />
                  And as life’s travels take us through,<br />
                  Let’s sing ourselves a joyful song.</p>
