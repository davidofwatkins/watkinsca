                                    Another year is winding down,<br />
                                    Shoppers rushing on their sorties,<br />
                                    A tree sits lighted in the town,<br />
                                    Cool air down into the forties.
                                </p>
                                <br />

                                    The theme should now be gratitude,<br />
                                    Goodwill to each and every one,<br />
                                    But often we get attitude,<br />
                                    Rushing to get our giving done.
                                </p>

                                    If the season’s rush and bustle,<br />
                                    Has left you with a sense of dread,<br />
                                    We suggest you dodge the hustle,<br />
                                    By catching up on us instead.

                                    So please reserve a little time,<br />
                                    To learn about our year’s events,<br />
                                    And browse through this year’s Christmas rhyme,<br />
                                    Our journeys, foibles and laments.
                                </p>

                                    Behold comes now the teenage boy,<br />
                                    Graduated middle school,<br />
                                    Now our sophomore pride and joy,<br />
                                    Is learning new ways to be cool.
                                </p>

                                    Homework is a new found shock,<br />
                                    Remember your old high school daze?<br />
                                    Sometimes fun, sometimes a crock,<br />
                                    A time of learning brand new ways.
                                </p>

                                    Time together’s changed a little,<br />
                                    Our focus now on education,<br />
                                    On travel we were non-committal,<br />
                                    Eeking out just one vacation.
                                </p>
                                <br />

                                    Briefly let us tell you how we<br />
                                    Traveled the Pacific Ocean,<br />
                                    Hung out on the shores of Maui,<br />
                                    Paradise without commotion.
                                </p>

                                    Helicoptered to volcanoes<br />
                                    Swam with turtles, snorkeled, sailed,<br />
                                    Time stands still when anything goes,<br />
                                    And this time only fun prevailed.

                                    Near home we found within our reach,<br />
                                    A sanctuary place to stay,<br />
                                    In the town of Solana Beach,<br />
                                    A forty minute drive away.
                                </p>

                                    Renting there we’ve found a refuge,<br />
                                    Where Bogie runs along the shore,<br />
                                    Respite from living’s daily deluge,<br />
                                    Where Mary finds that less is more.
                                </p>

                                    Calm and nurture Mary’s spirit,<br />
                                    And something there somehow renews,<br />
                                    Our inner voice and how we hear it.<br />
                                </p>

                                    And Jean of course the matriarch,<br />
                                    Has walked the beach and sandy shores,<br />
                                    She still has that old Keown spark.

                                    With friends we sailed in San Diego,<br />
                                    And dined together afterward,<br />
                                    It’s more fun than a Winnebago<br />
                                    (Just thought it fun to rhyme that word).

                                    Found themselves in Santa Fe,<br />
                                    Culturally fascinated.

                                    Involved big change at David’s work,<br />
                                    New owners brought financial aids, <br />
                                    And gave us tasks we could not shirk.

                                    Improving, growing ever more.

                                    Stopped by Jean’s and we all met,<br />
                                    To catch up on the latest story,<br />
                                    And she came back via Charismas jet.

                                    We went to ski with Tina B.,<br />
                                    And zip-treked over mountains too, <br />
                                    Canada's Whistler in B. C.,<br />
                                    Had fun things for us all to do.

                                    It seems that many families, <br />
                                    Over time grow far apart,<br />
                                    Because there are no guarantees,<br />
                                    We need to hold them in our heart.
                                </p>

                                    That’s the gift the season brings,<br />
                                    That the essential can’t be seen,<br />
                                    So don’t get caught-up getting things,<br />
                                    And strive instead to be serene.
