                        And finished with two thousand ten,<br />
                        We'd like to share some of our thoughts,<br />
                        And contemplate the year again.</p><br />
                        
                        <p>This was the year of dreams come true,<br />
                        It's more to do with meanings now,<br />
                        Not so much with things we do,<br />
                        More of whom we're with and how.</p><br />
                        
                       <p>Natalie and David travelled,<br />
                        To Costa Rica, her true love,<br />
                        As foretold, his stress unraveled,<br />
                        In the mountains high above.</p><br />
                        
                        <p>From those mountains to the coast,<br />
                        They traveled in camaraderie,<br />
                        But what they will recall the most,<br />
                        Is their together memory.</p><br />
                        
                        <p>In the Spring Savannah called,<br />
                        Mary and David saw the chance,<br />
                        To see this place of southern fame,<br />
                        And to rekindle their romance.</p><br />
                        
                        <p>David left for home thereafter,<br />
                        As Mary met her dear friend Lile,<br />
                        Brought her joy with friendship's laugher,<br />
                        Broke from life's rut, southern style.</p><br />
                        
                        <p>College roommates years ago,<br />
                        They shared old memories and fun,<br />
                        Recounting their life's ebb and flow,<br />
                        Traveled 'round in southern sun.</p><br />
                        
                        <p>Triggered by such energy,<br />
                        Mary carried on her quest,<br />
                        With David's daughters family,<br />
                        And love and friendship, all the best.</p><br />
                        
                        <p>With joy awakened in her heart,<br />
                        As life revealed its blissful tone,<br />
                        Came time for Boston to depart,<br />
                        For peace and thoughtful time alone.</p><br />
                        
                        <p>With a mom's anticipation,<br />
                        Saw friends then Binks up in Vermont,<br />
                        School was out and with elation,<br />
                        Saw Nat perform as was our want.</p><br />
                        
                        <p>Seems for just a little while,<br />
                        We tried to just enjoy the weather,<br />
                        Then we gathered with a smile,<br />
                        For a friendly get-together.</p><br />
                        
                        <p>To every house an invitation,<br />
                        We didn't know just who would show,<br />
                        Arriving without hesitation,<br />
                        Were neighbors that we've come to know.</p><br />
                        
                        <p>His college year a great success,<br />
                        Binks made the Deans' List freshman year,<br />
                        His first job then at BMS,<br />
                        On Help Desk doing well we hear.</p><br />
                        
                        <p>Then David had an old time yearning,<br />
                        Out of college 40 years,<br />
                        Went back to celebrate the learning,<br />
                        Shared with laughter and some tears.</p><br />
                        
                        <p>Yet we knew we'd soon depart,<br />
                        And south to Mexico be heading*,<br />
                        A celebration of the heart,<br />

                        Joy and loved expressed, yet too,<br />

                        As well there is a sense of healings,<br />
                        As brought together in reunion,<br />
                        We bring together human feelings.</p><br />

                       <p>Binks went back with Nat for voice,<br />
                        Returned with Dad to go to school,<br />
                        Dad's visit there was the right choice,<br />
                        Saw Nat, the kids and grandkids too.</p><br />
                        
                        <p>Saw friend Mike, and Rob, and Julie,<br />
                        All helped to make the moments dear,<br />

                        <p>September was a memory,<br />
                        Of Mary and David's history,<br />
                        Their 20th anniversary,<br />
                        Toasting love's great mystery.</p><br />
                        
                        <p>In San Diego, spent the night,<br />
                        For romance and a celebration,<br />
                        Then Mary got to take a flight,<br />
                        To Heather's for a short vacation.</p><br />
                        
                        <p>In Sonoma David met her,<br />
                        Arrived with Myron and with Sue,<br />
                        A day relaxed was even better,<br />
                        When the Banks' clan joined us too.</p><br />
                        
                        <p>San Francisco called our name,<br />
                        Where we met and fell in love,<br />
                        To old haunts, some still the same,<br />
                        As cable cars passed by above.</p><br />
                        
                        <p>Spent time in old Montreal,<br />
                        Enroute to Binks' parents weekend<br />
                        Enjoyed the bright New England Fall,<br />
                        Two places that we recommend.</p><br />
                        
                        <p>We saw Death Valley in December,<br />
                        Dramatic beauty and serene,<br />
                        A peaceful place we will remember,<br />
                        A quiet, peaceful desert scene.</p><br />
                        
                        <p>Now Binks is home and Bogie plays,<br />
                        Sometimes they go where they should not,<br />
                        Yet we enjoy these school break days,<br />
                        Thankful we for what we've got.</p><br />
                        
                        <p>Yet the yearend's almost here,<br />
                        And if you feel decreased elation,<br />
                        Know good fortune's very near,<br />
                        There's reason for appreciation.</p><br />
